JSP: JSP Stand for Java Server Pages.
Jsp remove lot of boilerplat code.
Jsp can perform dynamic result or static result.
Jsp provide scripting tag for executing dynamic result.
There are three type of scripting tag:
1. <%%> scripting tag-> every thing goes in service method every thing local.
2. <%!%> declartion tag.
3. <%=%> expression tag.
In Jsp we can call external css or js also.
In Jsp we dont need to overide any method like (get(),post(), service() etc.).
Jsp code internally translate to servlet then compile.

we cannot declare static method in scripting tag only declare final.

Jsp provide 9 implicit object:
1.request
2.out
3.response
4.config
5.application
6.session
7.exception
8.page
9.pageContext

//exception object is not available by default.
//these 9 object use only in scripting tag and expression tag;
//nested tag not allowed.

Jsp provide directive tag to perform different kind of task.
1.page
2.include
3.taglib

In jsp session is true by default.

drawback:
jsp is slow
jsp in not secure

use in mvc pattern for view rendering
